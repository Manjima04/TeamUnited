                <h2>Kolkata famous food lasts for years</h2>
                <p>
                    The webpage is about kolkata's unkonwn places which is running through years,but most people dont't know about it are unware about it.
                    It’s almost as if, if you take out food from it, Kolkata would just cease to exist. From patrons of Rasgulla to the potato combined biriyani, Kolkata offers an array of cuisines for all gourmands out there. From the time when it used to be the Capital till 1911, to now in 2023, food has been an integral part of city influenced by a century of immigrating cultures and cuisines, which is a well-known fact amongst the residents of the city. What most of them don’t know is that, it also hosts few of the oldest restaurants in the nation. I believe that was the only upside of the colonization by the East India company which influenced a lot of modern day, yet old restaurants which still exist in the city are loved by all.
                    So here I present my list of the top Oldest restaurants in the city.

            <h3>Golbari</h3>
            <p>
              Kolkata is incomplete without its North Kolkata charm, which brings me to my next place. For generations on end, Golbari and Kosha Mangsho have been synonymous. What’s so exquisite about this place is that even after 94 years of running, it has never changed its menu. This places once known as the New Punjabi restaurant is now colloquially been renamed to Golbari for its spherical facade ( ‘gol’ meaning circle in Bengali). What most people do not know about this place is that Golbari famous for serving Bengali delicacies like Kosha Mangsho was started by a Punjabi and not a Bengali. If you are in Kolkata, your trip won’t be worthwhile until you try the soft mutton cooked in the dark velvety texture of gravy otherwise popularly known as Kosha Mangsho. And mind you, they have no branches!
